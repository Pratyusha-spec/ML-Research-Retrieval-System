# ML-Research-Retrieval-System
The ML-Powered Academic Research Retrieval and Relevance System is an intelligent academic search engine designed to improve how researchers discover, rank, and understand scholarly papers.

Traditional academic search engines primarily rely on keyword-based matching, which often produces a large number of loosely related results. Users must manually browse papers, download PDFs, and extract relevant information — a time-consuming and inefficient process.

This project solves that problem by introducing a semantic, machine learning–driven retrieval system powered by:

Transformer-based embeddings (SciBERT)

Vector similarity search (FAISS)

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

Abstractive summarization (T5)

Relevance classification and ranking

Instead of simply returning a list of papers, the system:

Understands the context of the user’s query

Retrieves semantically relevant academic papers

Classifies them into relevance levels

Generates concise, context-aware summaries
